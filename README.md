### Project Description: Time Zone Determination

**Functionality:**
1. **Country Selection:** The user will be able to select a country from a dropdown list on a web page. The list will include various countries, each associated with its corresponding time zone.

2. **Displaying Time Zone:** After selecting a country and submitting the form, the script will process the request and display the time zone associated with the selected country. If the country is not found in the database, a message will be shown indicating this.

3. **Displaying Current Time:** In addition to the time zone, the script will also show the current time for the selected country. This will be achieved by setting the time zone according to the selected time zone using the `date()` function.

**User Interface:**
- The page will have a simple form with a dropdown list for selecting a country.
- After selecting a country and clicking the button, the user will see the time zone and the current time for the selected country.

**Technical Requirements:**
- Use PHP to handle requests and generate HTML code.
- Implement an associative array to store information about countries and their time zones.
- Utilize standard PHP functions for working with dates and times.

This project will help practice skills in working with forms, arrays, and data processing in PHP.
